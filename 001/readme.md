## Assignment Banner - Requirements

### Overview

- The assignment banner is purely an organizational addition for Professor Griffin to keep your assignments organized. 
- That does not mean you can choose not to do it, or do it incorrectly.
- Students majoring in computer science (or Meng or Math) should not have trouble doing this correctly.
- The banner is a **COVER SHEET** which is printed on its OWN page. 
- It simply requires 3 pieces of information:
  - Assignment Code (e.g. P02, H01, etc.)
  - Course Number (2143, 3013)
  - Last Name
- Here is multiple ways of creating this sheet.

#### VSCode Plugin

- Search For the `Banner Comments +` VSCode extension and install it:
  1. Click on the extensions icon
  2. Type banner in the search box
  3. Choose the banner extension and install it

- At this point you have banner installed, and you have a readable default font chosen as the default.
- This is the easy part.
- Type the 3 items you need to make the banner.
- Then highlight them

- You can figure out how to print this banner out on its own page. I have faith in you, and your grade depends on it.
